### Project Description
Food listings may remain active even after becoming unsafe Recipients may not know the ingredients (risking allergies). Automatically remove expired food listings from the website
 Display only safe and available food
 Include a rating system for donors and receivers
 Enable quick claiming and pickup


### The Problem statement
A significant amount of edible food is wasted daily by restaurants, event organizers, and households due to the absence of a structured and real-time redistribution system. At the same time, many individuals and communities face food insecurity. Currently, there is no comprehensive digital platform where donors can log in and update detailed information about surplus food, such as the name of the food item, quantity available, ingredients used, pickup time, and expiry time. Existing systems also lack automatic expiry management, removal of outdated listings, and a rating mechanism to ensure trust and accountability. As a result: Food listings may remain active even after becoming unsafe Recipients may not know the ingredients (risking allergies).

### The Solution
We propose developing a web-based platform where restaurants, event organizers, and households can:

Log in and post leftover food details

Enter food name and available quantity

Provide ingredient information for safety

Specify pickup and expiry time

The system will:

✔ Automatically remove expired food listings from the website
✔ Display only safe and available food
✔ Include a rating system for donors and receivers
✔ Enable quick claiming and pickup

This ensures safe, transparent, and efficient redistribution of surplus food while reducing waste and supporting communities in need.create an front end code which include all of this features

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**

- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Ately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
